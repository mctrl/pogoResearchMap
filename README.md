## Welcome to Pogo Research Map

This is just a small project that was built for the small but **Strong** Pokemon go Community in the City of Derby UK

 - This project uses the Following Technologies
 - Pushbullet for Notfications to myself of when a user submits a
   Research Task
 - Google sheets API to record submissions
 - Google Fusion Tables that read from the Google sheet and create a
   sort of Database Structure
 - Google maps API + Fusion tables to form a Data Layer on the google
   map.
 - Utilising Geolocation to find the user location to submit stops no
   matter where they are.
 - Ability to Drag the location pin to post Research Tasks that may not
   be where the user is standing.

All of the API Keys in the project are public so please change these to your own and do not abuse them, if i start recieving a ton of traffic i will change the API keys. 


## Google Sheets / Fusion Tables code

This code is not available within this Repo and this Readme is not intended to be a tutorial on how to set up this project on your own servers. 

If you wish to clone this repo please change the **Pushbullet API** key or comment out the call to the code all together. Also the **Google maps API** key will only work from domains i have permitted it too so please change this to your own also
